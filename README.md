# Udacity Project: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Summary: In this project, I model data from a fictious company called Sparkify by creating tables in Apache Cassandra.
I build an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file
to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
